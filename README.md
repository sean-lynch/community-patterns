# Common Tools Community Patterns

## ⚠️ WARNING: Early Development - Not Ready for Most Users

**This project is in active, rapid development.** The framework underneath changes constantly, often breaking existing patterns without warning. Documentation is sparse, incomplete, and frequently outdated.

### What You're Getting Into

- **Breaking changes daily**: APIs change, patterns stop working, no migration guides
- **Minimal documentation**: Most learning happens by reading code and asking questions
- **Frustrating iteration cycles**: Compile errors with unclear messages, runtime behavior that doesn't match expectations
- **Tool instability**: Development tools are experimental and may have bugs or missing features
- **Time investment**: Expect to spend significant time debugging issues that aren't your fault

### This Is For You If:

- ✅ You're comfortable with unstable, rapidly-changing APIs
- ✅ You enjoy debugging obscure framework issues
- ✅ You're excited to contribute to early-stage development
- ✅ You can tolerate wasted hours when things break
- ✅ You don't need your patterns to keep working long-term

### This Is NOT For You If:

- ❌ You want a stable, well-documented framework
- ❌ You need patterns that continue working over time
- ❌ You expect responsive support or detailed guides
- ❌ You're easily frustrated by broken tools
- ❌ You're looking for a production-ready system

**Still interested?** You've been warned. See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) if you're ready to proceed.
