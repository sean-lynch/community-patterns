# Cozy Poll Pattern - PRD

## Overview

A collaborative voting system for small groups (3-20 people) to make decisions together, like choosing where to go for lunch. The system emphasizes social dynamics and transparency - everyone sees who voted for what in real-time.

## Core Concept

Each poll has multiple options (e.g., restaurant choices). Voters rate each option as:
- 🟢 **Green** (LOVE IT) - Strong preference
- 🟡 **Yellow** (I can live with it) - Acceptable
- 🔴 **Red** (I CAN'T live with it) - Veto/strong opposition

The winning option is determined by:
1. **Primary sort**: Fewest red votes (minimize opposition)
2. **Secondary sort**: Most green votes (maximize enthusiasm)

## User Roles

### Admin (Poll Creator)
- Person who creates the poll
- Can add/remove options
- Can reset votes (keep options)
- Can clear all options (start fresh)
- Can see live results like everyone else

### Voters
- Anyone who joins the poll via URL
- Enter their name/initials when first joining
- Can vote on any/all options
- Can change their votes at any time
- See live results as people vote

## Architecture

### Multi-Charm System

**Admin Pattern ("Poll Lobby")**
- Single charm created by poll organizer
- Holds shared poll data (question, options, votes)
- Has "Join as Voter" button that creates new voter charms
- Tracks list of voter charms created
- Shows live results to admin
- Provides admin controls (add/remove options, reset)
- URL is shared with team to join the poll

**Voter Pattern (created per voter)**
- Separate charm instance created for each voter
- Created when someone clicks "Join as Voter" in lobby
- Receives `options` and `votes` as cell references (shared with admin)
- Has local `myName` cell (stored only in this voter's charm)
- Charm title: `"{voterName} - {question} - Voter"`
- Each voter gets their own unique URL to return to
- Updates shared votes cell when voting

**Key Architectural Decisions:**
1. **Security**: Admin charm URL stays separate from voter URLs
2. **Isolation**: Each voter has their own charm with their own URL
3. **Shared Data**: options and votes are linked via cell references
4. **Local Data**: Each voter's name is stored only in their charm
5. **Scalability**: Creating many voter charms won't spam the charm list due to descriptive naming

### Data Structure

```typescript
interface Vote {
  voterName: string;      // "Alice" or "AK"
  optionId: string;       // UUID of option
  voteType: "green" | "yellow" | "red";
}

interface Option {
  id: string;            // UUID
  title: string;         // "Chipotle", "Taco Bell", etc.
}

interface VoterCharmRef {
  id: string;            // Unique ID for tracking
  charm: any;            // Voter charm instance
  voterName: string;     // Name for display in list
}

interface AdminInput {
  question: Cell<Default<string, "">>;
  options: Cell<Default<Option[], []>>;
  votes: Cell<Default<Vote[], []>>;
  voterCharms: Cell<Default<VoterCharmRef[], []>>;
  nextOptionId: Cell<Default<number, 1>>;
  myName: Cell<Default<string, "">>;  // Admin can vote too
}

interface VoterInput {
  question: string;      // Read-only, passed from admin
  options: Cell<Option[]>;  // Shared via cell reference
  votes: Cell<Vote[]>;      // Shared via cell reference
  myName: Cell<Default<string, "">>;  // Local to this voter
}
```

### Technical Implementation

**Charm Creation Flow**:
1. User clicks "Join as Voter" button in admin pattern
2. Handler creates new voter pattern instance via `CozyPollBallot({ ... })`
3. `lift` function stores voter instance in `voterCharms` array
4. Cell references for `options` and `votes` are passed to voter
5. System navigates user to their new voter charm URL
6. Voter enters their name (stored locally in their charm)
7. Voter votes → updates shared `votes` cell
8. All charms (admin + all voters) see the update

**Cell Reference Sharing**:
```typescript
// In admin pattern:
const voterInstance = CozyPollBallot({
  question: question.get(),  // Plain value
  options,  // Cell reference (shared)
  votes,    // Cell reference (shared)
  myName: Cell.of(""),  // New local cell for this voter
});
```

**Title Generation**:
- Admin charm: `"Cozy Poll: {question}"`
- Voter charm: `"{voterName} - {question} - Voter"`
- Example: `"Alice - Where should we go for lunch? - Voter"`

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Admin Creates Poll

1. Admin creates new Cozy Poll charm
2. Enters poll question (e.g., "Where should we go for lunch?")
3. Adds option titles (e.g., "Chipotle", "Taco Bell", "Thai Kitchen")
4. Each option gets a unique ID
5. Shares **admin charm URL** with team
6. Admin can also vote (has own name field)

### Flow 2: Voter Joins Poll

1. Voter opens admin charm URL (the "lobby")
2. Sees current poll question and live results
3. Clicks "Join as Voter" button
4. **New voter charm is created** and voter is navigated to it
5. Voter enters their name (stored locally in their charm)
6. Voter saves their voter charm URL to return later
7. Voter sees all options with current vote visualization
8. Voter sees top-ranked option prominently displayed

### Flow 3: Voting

1. Voter sees list of all options
2. Each option shows:
   - Option title
   - Row of colored dots (green/yellow/red) with initials in each dot
   - Current ranking indication
3. Voter clicks an option
4. Sees three buttons: 🟢 Green, 🟡 Yellow, 🔴 Red
5. Clicks a vote button
6. Dot with their initials appears in that color
7. Results re-rank instantly
8. Everyone sees the update in real-time

### Flow 4: Changing a Vote

1. Voter clicks an option they already voted on
2. Their current vote is highlighted
3. Clicks a different color button
4. Their dot moves to the new color
5. Results update for everyone

### Flow 5: Admin Resets Votes

1. Admin clicks "Reset Votes" button
2. Confirmation: "Clear all votes but keep options?"
3. All votes cleared
4. Options remain
5. All viewers see empty vote state

### Flow 6: Admin Clears Options

1. Admin clicks "Clear Options" button
2. Confirmation: "Clear all options? This will also clear votes."
3. All options and votes cleared
4. Back to empty state
5. All viewers see empty poll

## UI Design

### Results Display (Top of Screen)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  🏆 TOP CHOICE                      │
│  Chipotle                           │
│  🟢🟢🟢🟢 🟡🟡 🔴                 │
│  (4 love it, 2 okay, 1 can't)      │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Options List

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Chipotle                       [RANK 1]

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Each dot is a small circle with initials centered inside.

### Voting Interface (When Option Clicked)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Chipotle - How do you feel?       │
│                                     │
│  [  🟢 LOVE IT  ]                  │
│  [  🟡 CAN LIVE WITH IT  ]         │
│  [  🔴 CAN'T LIVE WITH IT  ]       │
│                                     │
│  [Cancel]                           │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Admin Controls (Bottom of Admin View)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Admin Controls                     │
│  [+ Add Option]                     │
│  [Reset Votes]                      │

└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Ranking Algorithm

```typescript
function rankOptions(options: Option[], votes: Vote[]): Option[] {
  return options.toSorted((a, b) => {
    const aVotes = votes.filter(v => v.optionId === a.id);
    const bVotes = votes.filter(v => v.optionId === b.id);

    // Count reds (fewer is better)
    const aReds = aVotes.filter(v => v.voteType === "red").length;
    const bReds = bVotes.filter(v => v.voteType === "red").length;

    if (aReds !== bReds) {
      return aReds - bReds; // Ascending (fewer reds = better)
    }

    // Count greens (more is better)
    const aGreens = aVotes.filter(v => v.voteType === "green").length;
    const bGreens = bVotes.filter(v => v.voteType === "green").length;

    return bGreens - aGreens; // Descending (more greens = better)
  });
}
```

## Key Features

### Real-Time Social Dynamics
- Everyone sees votes as they come in
- Social pressure visible: "Oh no, my favorite has 3 reds!"
- Transparent: No hidden votes or secret ballots
- Encourages discussion and consensus

### Flexible Voting
- Vote on as many or as few options as you want
- Change votes at any time
- No "submit" button - instant feedback
- Visual feedback with dots and initials

### Simple Ranking
1. Avoid options people can't accept (minimize reds)
2. Choose options people love (maximize greens)
3. Clear winner emerges naturally

### Admin Controls
- Add options during voting (if people suggest new ideas)
- Reset votes without losing options
- Clear everything for a new poll

## Edge Cases

### No Votes Yet
- Show options with empty dot rows
- Display: "Waiting for votes..."
- Top choice shows: "No votes yet"

### Tie for First Place
- Show both options as "TOP CHOICE (tied)"
- Or show both with equal prominence

### Someone Removes Their Vote
- Option to click a vote dot to remove it
- Or click "Clear My Vote" button on voting interface

### Very Long Option Names
- Truncate at ~30 characters
- Show full name on hover or in voting interface

### Many Voters (15-20)
- Dots become small but still show initials
- Consider wrapping to multiple rows
- Or use "+5 more" collapse pattern

## Success Metrics

### Core Experience
- Time from opening URL to first vote: < 30 seconds
- Votes per person: 2-5 on average
- Vote changes per person: 1-3 (shows engagement)

### Social Dynamics
- Groups reach consensus naturally
- Red votes spark discussion
- Clear winner emerges in 90%+ of polls

### Usability
- No confusion about how to vote
- Dot visualization makes results intuitive
- No need to explain the system

## Future Enhancements (Out of Scope for V1)

- **Comments**: Let people explain their votes
- **Vote weights**: Make some voters' opinions count more
- **Time limits**: Set voting deadline
- **Anonymous mode**: Hide who voted what
- **History**: Track past polls and decisions
- **Templates**: Common poll types (restaurants, movies, dates)
- **Integrations**: Pull restaurant data, show maps, etc.

## Development Approach

### Phase 1: Admin Pattern (Base)
1. Create poll data structure
2. Add/remove options functionality
3. Display options list
4. Basic ranking algorithm
5. Reset controls

### Phase 2: Voting Mechanism
1. Add votes array to state
2. Implement voting UI (vote buttons)
3. Display votes as colored dots
4. Update ranking in real-time
5. Vote change functionality

### Phase 3: Voter Pattern (Multi-User)
1. Create voter sub-pattern
2. Name entry on first load
3. Connect to shared poll data via cell refs
4. Test with multiple instances
5. Verify real-time updates work

### Phase 4: Polish
1. Improve dot visualization
2. Add initials to dots
3. Top choice prominent display
4. Admin controls styling
5. Responsive layout
6. Edge case handling

## Technical Considerations

### Cell References
- Use cell references to share data between patterns
- Avoid copying data when possible
- Let reactivity handle updates automatically

### Vote Updates
- Use vote array with voter name + option ID + vote type
- Find and update existing vote, or add new vote
- Use `votes.get()` and `votes.set()` for updates

### Computed Values
- Ranking algorithm as computed cell
- Vote counts per option as computed
- Top choice as computed
- These update automatically when votes change

### Pattern Launching
- Main pattern provides "Join as Voter" button
- Or auto-detect if user is admin vs voter
- Pass poll data cells to voter pattern

### UUID Generation
- Use `crypto.randomUUID()` for option IDs
- Ensures uniqueness across options
- Stable IDs for vote references

## Open Questions for Development

1. **Voter pattern launching**: Button-based or automatic detection?
2. **Vote removal**: Explicit "Remove Vote" button or click-to-remove on dot?
3. **Styling**: Material design, minimalist, or playful/colorful?
4. **Mobile optimization**: How small can dots get while remaining usable?
5. **Poll persistence**: Should poll data persist between sessions?

## Example Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Lunch Decision
- Team of 6 people
- 4 restaurant options
- Everyone votes in 2 minutes
- Clear winner emerges: Mexican place (0 reds, 5 greens)
- Everyone happy, decision made

### Scenario 2: Contentious Choice
- Team of 10 people
- 5 options
- One option gets 7 reds - clearly eliminated
- Two options tied with 0 reds each
- Tied options both have social support
- Group discusses the two finalists
- A few people switch from yellow to green
- Winner emerges with 6 greens vs 4 greens

### Scenario 3: Adding Options Mid-Vote
- Poll starts with 3 options
- Someone suggests a 4th option during voting
- Admin adds it
- Everyone sees new option appear
- People vote on it
- It becomes the winner!

**End of PRD**

This document should guide the implementation of the cozy-poll pattern. The key insight is the social transparency - everyone sees everything in real-time, which creates natural consensus and discussion.
